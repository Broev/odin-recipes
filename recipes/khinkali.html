<h2>Meat-Filled Dumplings</h2>
<p>
  Khinkali are Georgian dumplings. They’re one of the country’s most popular
  foods and a favorite item at long dinner parties known as supras
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    2 cups all-purpose flour (about 8 1/2 ounces), plus more for work surface
  </li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
  <li>1/2 cup water</li>
  <li>Olive oil, for greasing</li>
  <li>4 ounces 80% lean ground beef</li>
  <li>4 ounces ground pork</li>
  <li>1/3 cup finely chopped yellow onion</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Stir together flour and salt in a medium bowl. Make a well in center of dry
    ingredients, and add 1/2 cup water and egg. Stir with a wooden spoon until a
    shaggy dough forms. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead
    until smooth and elastic, 4 to 5 minutes. Place dough in a lightly oiled
    bowl, and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Set aside.
  </li>
  <li>
    Using a fork or your hands, stir together all meat filling ingredients in a
    large bowl until ground meat is completely broken up and mixture is well
    blended.
  </li>
  <li>
    Divide dough into thirds. Shape 1 dough portion into a ball, and roll out to
    about 1/4-inch thickness on a lightly floured work surface. (Keep the
    remaining dough portions covered with plastic wrap while you work.) Using a
    2 1/2-inch round cutter, cut out 8 dough circles, rerolling dough scraps as
    necessary.
  </li>
  <li>
    Roll each dough circle into a larger 4-inch circle. Place about 1 tablespoon
    (about 1/2 ounce) meat filling in center of each dough circle, and pleat
    dough edge, gathering top like a pouch to enclose filling. When you have
    pleated all the way around, pinch top edges together firmly, and give the
    dough a little twist to make a stem and to make sure the khinkali is well
    sealed. (If you don’t want the stems, lightly press the twisted stem down
    into the dumpling with your finger.) Place finished dumplings on a piece of
    lightly floured parchment paper; cover loosely with plastic wrap, and repeat
    process with remaining dough portions and filling.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bring a large pot of salted water and bay leaves to a boil over high.
    Carefully add half of dumplings to water, and stir gently with a wooden
    spoon (without piercing dumplings) to make sure they don’t stick to bottom
    of pot. Boil until dough is tender and meat is cooked through, 8 to 10
    minutes. Remove khinkali with a spider, and drain on paper towels. Repeat
    with remaining half of dumplings. Sprinkle khinkali with black pepper, and
    serve hot.
