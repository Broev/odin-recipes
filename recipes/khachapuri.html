<h2>
  Ajarski khachapuri is a boat-shaped Georgian bread
  <br />
  with a cheese-stuffed crust and an egg baked into the center
</h2>
<p>
  This versatile bread takes a little finesse, but the payoff is well worth
  it;<br />
  after all, what more could you want other than cheesy, soft, chewy bread
  dipped in runny yolk and molten cheese?
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>½ cup warm milk</li>
  <li>⅓ cup warm water</li>
  <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
  <li>1 ½ teaspoons white sugar</li>
  <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed, for dusting</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
  <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Make dough: Combine milk, water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand
    until yeast forms a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Add 2 cups flour, olive
    oil, and salt; mix until a sticky dough forms.
  </li>
  <li>
    Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead for about 3 minutes, adding in
    remaining 1/4 cup flour as needed, until dough is very soft but still
    workable. Form into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover and let
    rise in a warm spot until doubled in volume, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
  </li>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).</li>
  <li>
    While dough rises, prepare cheese blend: Toss together feta, Monterey Jack,
    and mozzarella cheese in a medium bowl. Refrigerate cheese mixture until
    needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Punch down dough and turn out onto a floured surface. Flatten slightly and
    cut in half. Place 1 dough half on a sheet of parchment paper dusted with
    flour. Roll out into a rectangle about 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick.
  </li>
